# Web Scraping with Python

## Project Description
This Python project demonstrates how to scrape specific information, such as headlines or prices, from a webpage using the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` libraries. The program fetches and parses the webpage content and extracts the desired data using HTML tag identification.

## Features
- Fetches HTML content from a webpage using the `requests` library.
- Parses the HTML content using `BeautifulSoup`.
- Extracts specific information (e.g., headlines, prices) by identifying and targeting HTML tags.
- Outputs the extracted data in a readable format.

## How It Works
1. The `requests.get()` method downloads the HTML content from the specified URL.
2. The program parses the HTML using `BeautifulSoup` to create a searchable structure.
3. The `find()` or `find_all()` methods are used to extract the desired data (such as headlines within `<h2>` tags).
4. The extracted data is displayed in the console.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`

You can install the required libraries using `pip`:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
